# Fish-Weight-Prediction-App

I will introduce the easiest way to deploy machine learning applications on the web.It turned out that hyper tuned XGboost model performed best. That is why today we will build a Fish Weight Prediction web application using XGboost. In general, there are different options to deploy ML models, such as Flask, Django, Streamlit, etc. Today I will use Streamlit because it is the easiest and faster way to do it and it does not require any web development knowledge.

# Install necessary libraries

## step 1 : 

pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

## step 2 :

# Build the best machine learning model and Save it

streamlit run main.py
